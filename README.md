# IMDB-Rest-API

I used the beautiful soup library to scrape data from IMDb website and 
stored data in the form of a CSV file.

Then I uploaded the file to a PostgreSQL database. I did so manually
because I was initially having issues setting up the virtual environment 
due to which I couldn't use psycopg2.

After this step, the rest APIs were created in a visual studio using the 
Django Rest Framework. The API is present in the IMDb folder.
